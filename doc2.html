                <li>In early years Samsung was founded as a grocery trading store on March 1, 1938, by Lee Byung-Chull. He started his business in Taegu, Korea.<br> trading noodles and other goods produced in and around the city and exporting them to China and its provinces.

                            Samsung first entered the electronics industry in 1969 with several electronics-focused divisions. Their first products were black-and-white televisions.

             <h4>Lee Byung-Chull died in 1987 and was succeeded by his son Lee Kun-Hee. Samsung was split into five companies; electronics remained under Lee Kun-Hee’s leadership, and the other four companies were run by other sons and daughters of Lee Byung-Chull. Lee Kun-Hee felt that Samsung had become complacent because of its dominant position in the South Korean economy and was unprepared for global competition. He famously said to Samsung executives, “Change everything but your wife and kids.”</h4>
